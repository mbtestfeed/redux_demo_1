# redux_demo_1

A basic redux demo built off of the back of a [Pluralsight course](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=react-redux-react-router-es6). The purpose of this was to set up a redux project more or less from scratch so that I could get a better grasp of all the things involved in that process, and may not prove as useful to others. If you're looking to learn React or Redux, PluralSight is a much better bet. The components themselves are largely copied from the pluralsight course, while being genericised so that other things can be built off of this more easily.

A step by step guide to the process of setting this can be requested for here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y4nnvuMGWTWFqt1EkOKeNUN9Kp3je7cjr125o9eAifk/edit
This document is still a work in progress while I fix up a few last things, and then will likely be published more openly.

To install this project from this repo rather than following the document, clone this project into a folder then run `npm install` and you should be good to run `npm start` and see the project in your browser. Whoo!
